Welcome to my first post on the new SLOP website! It is still very much a work in progress but feel
with the main hurdles past me that I can see the finish line. Over the last couple of months I have:
1. Finished the project so that now I consider it to be code complete
2. Written a fair amount of the documentation which can be seen here
3. Published the project to Maven Central

In the upcoming months I will look to do the following:

1. Finish of the documentation
2. Gradually complete the sample projects and document each
3. Start to advertise a bit!

There will be many more updates so please do keep checking back.
