Just thought I'd update this as it's been a while since I pushed any changes. I have been taking a couple of weeks
off from SLOP development due to holidays and well, just having a break. Now that I'm back I have come up with
an updated list of tasks I'd like to complete. These are:
1. Completing the documentation (This will be done over the next week or so)
2. Implementing the first of the sample projects which likely to be the documentation template engine
3. Address the issues I've raised in the gitlab project
4. A "Try it now" page to the website. I've still not finalized how this would work (free-tier AWS service maybe), 
but it would give people a chance to experiment with it before using it in their project.

There are some more advanced features I am planning though at this stage I have no date on when these will be
attempted:
1. A debugger for evaluation / stepping through your expressions!
2. An online expression IDE supporting code completion - sounds pretty crazy but actually shouldn't be that hard

Now that I am back from my break I am planning on updating this site more so please keep checking back.
