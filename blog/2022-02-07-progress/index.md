Welcome to my first post on the new SLOP website. It is very much a work in progress but feel with many of 
the main hurdles past me that I can see the finishing line. Over the last couple of months I have achieved
the following:
1. Got the project up to the point where I now consider it to be functionally complete
2. Written a fair amount of the [documentation](/docs/intro)
3. Published the project to Maven Central

In the upcoming months I will look to do the following:

1. Finish the documentation
2. Start work and publishing the sample projects with accompanying documentation
3. Address any bugs / issues which arise
3. Start to advertise a bit

There will be many more updates to follow so please do keep checking back.
