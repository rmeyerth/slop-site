Back with another update I've just released v1.2 with bug fixes and new features. I've now finished fixed all
known bugs found during testing. Please let me know if there are any others that I am missing and I will
add them to the issues board and resolve them as soon as possible. I have renewed vigour regarding releasing
updates and have recently added a Map type which I will add to the documentation shortly. Other things I am planning
soon are:
1. A syntax highlighting check as the errors if a typing mistake are not exactly helpful currently!
2. Dipping my toe into the React arena by creating a Grammar Pattern generator based on statement examples.
3. Continuing with work on the SLOP-Doc project which is going to be the first sample project to be released.

Things are going well as in March we had over 100 unique IP's download the project and similar in April! It's not 
surprising given that typing in "Extensible Expression Language" into Google places us 6th and Bing at number 1. 
Again, please do reach out if you had any feedback or come across any issues as I will respond as soon as I can.
