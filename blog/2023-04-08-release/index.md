I am excited to announce the release of SLOP 1.37, a major update that focuses on improving the 
stability and reliability of the language. This update resolves all known issues and bugs, 
making SLOP more robust and efficient than ever.

I have also added a new feature that lets you try out SLOP expressions directly from your browser. 
Just click on the “Try it now” button on the main menu and you can start writing and running your 
own expressions without any installation or setup. This feature is currently in beta, but I am 
working hard to make it more powerful and user-friendly.

I have big plans for this feature and want to make it easier for you to learn and use SLOP. 
That’s why I will soon update all the SLOP code examples in the documentation section with a link to 
this page, so you can see them in action and modify them as you wish. As it is in beta, I am aware of
issues when defining variables but will aim to fix them as soon as possible.

I hope you enjoy this update and find it useful for your projects. As always, if you have any feedback, 
questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me via email and I will get back to you as soon 
as possible.
