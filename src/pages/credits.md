If you've read through the Quick Start section or are a newcomer to expression languages, you may be asking yourself
that question. Looking around for an answer on the web is not that easy. There are well established expression languages (EL)
out there including [Jexl](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/) and [SpeL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/5.3.0.RELEASE/reference/html/spel.html), but most sites seem to dive into how to use them rather than
explain why you'd actually want to do so. They mention something about dynamic configuration / scripting and then move on.
As such, complaints like these usually follow:
1. No IDE support to help write it
2. No perceived type safety
3. Why use it when you can just write native code?
