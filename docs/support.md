# Questions & Answers
#### Why have you removed the sample project's section of the documentation?
I've recently removed this section as they were only placeholders with ideas. I am currently working on a major
project using SLOP which I will update the site with as soon as I have something to share. I would like to create
some other small projects to show off SLOP, but as I only have limited time to work on it I have to prioritise
accordingly.
#### Do you actually look at your forum at all? Aside from the initial post it is completely empty and devoid of life
I do look in now and then and will respond to any posts which are made there. Please post a thread or message though
if you've got any ideas, issues, opinions or would just like to say hi!
#### Why did you bother creating another expression language when they are not that popular?
As I mentioned elsewhere, I really fell into the project by creating a very primitive version of an EL at work. I 
took what and really liked the thought of being able to create a language which anyone could use at any time, but also
expand with ease. This project may not change the popularity of ELs, but just by being able to write my own expressions,
statements which I can use in my projects, I feel I've achieved my goal. I hope to bring more attention to this 
project with the release of my next project SLOP Docs (placeholder), but I've still a way to go before I announce 
anything on that.
#### Do you have any timescales on this new project you're working on?
I am spending all of my free time working on it, but as of yet have nothing to share. From the people I've shown, I've
had very positive feedback though so this has driven me to keep pushing forward with it. I will update the site once
I have more to share.
