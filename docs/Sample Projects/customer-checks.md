# Customer Checks
Custom rules could be stored against a customer record. For example, a customer could call up a bank and provide a list 
of requirements where they would like to be notified of such an event. By adding these dynamic rules directly to the
customers record (or another table) and providing the relevant resources, events can be triggered to handle such scenarios.
