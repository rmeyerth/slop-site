# Introduction
If you've read through the quick start guide, you're probably now asking yourself "...but when would I ever use this?!".
The following section will take you through some example projects to hopefully not just answer that question but also 
make you think diffierently about software development as strict code releases and patch cycles.

**NOTE**: All of these projects are a work in progress and below are some small descriptions of what they will be when
finished.
