# Overview
If you've read through the quick start guide, you're probably now asking yourself "...but when would I ever use this?!".
The following section will take you through some example projects. This will hopefully not just answer that initial 
question but also possibly make you think differently about strict software development releases and patch cycles.

**NOTE**: Unfortunately due to my limited spare time I have to work on this project, I am looking to complete the 
documentation first before starting these projects. Each project will be used as an example of how SLOP or any
expression language could be used to help your project through dynamic configuration. In the case of the document
generator, it may even save you money given most current options are subscription based or payware. In any case, I 
am making updates to this project daily and will update these pages as and when I have news.
